# standard-multichain

An example on signing and executing transactions across multiple blockchain protocols from one NEAR account

> Currently only available on **testnet**, and should be used to control only `testnet` accounts on other chains

---

## Requirements

- `npm` or `yarn`
- NEAR `testnet` account using [MyNEARWallet](https://testnet.mynearwallet.com/) or [Meteor Wallet](https://wallet.meteorwallet.app/wallet)

## Installation

```bash
npm install # or yarn
npm run dev # or yarn dev
```

How this example works is explained in the [documentation](https://docs.near.org/build/chain-abstraction/chain-signatures).

> [!CAUTION]
> Chain Signatures are currently in `alpha` and should only be used in a `testnet` environment.
